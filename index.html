        <p>1. Design a function that reverses the digits of an integer. For example, 50 
            should become 5 and -12 should become -21.</p>

        <p>3. Design a function that takes a string or sequence of characters as input and 
            returns the character that appears most frequently.
            //Eg 11189 => '1'
            //hello => l</p>

        <p>4.Design a function that determines whether a given string is a pangram. A 
            pangram is a sentence or phrase containing every letter of the alphabet at 
            least once. Punctuation and case are typically ignored. For example, the 
            string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, while 
            "Hello, world!" is not.</p>

        <p>5. Design a function that takes a list of integers as input. The function should 
            return True if the list contains two consecutive threes (3 next to a 3) anywhere 
            within the list. Otherwise, it should return False. For example, the function 
            should return True for [1, 3, 3] and False for [1, 3, 1, 3].</p>

        <p>6. Master Yoda, a renowned Jedi Master from the Star Wars universe, is known 
            for his unique way of speaking. He often reverses the order of words in his 
            sentences. For example, instead of saying "I am home" he might say "Home 
            am I" Design a function that takes a sentence as input and returns a new 
            sentence with the words reversed in the same order that Master Yoda would 
            use.</p>
